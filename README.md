# audible-plot

A python module to "plot" simple data series as audible speech and
tones (and also as a conventional visual plot).

## Purpose

We created audible-plot to support blind accessible teaching and study
of Algebra, which involves the graphing of lines and polynomials.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by @andadapt /
[audioplot](https://github.com/andadapt/audioplot "a python module for
converting data arrays to audio streams"), which is unfortunately no
longer working due to an unmaintained dependency.

This project is built upon the work of many others that contributed to
its dependencies:

- Python, the [Python Software Foundation](https://python.org)
- TODO: expand this list
