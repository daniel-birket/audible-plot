# Typing _ Readme

"typing" is a Python project that captures the keyboard and then plays a sound based on which key was pressed. This project demonstrates how to capture the keyboard input and play a sound based on the key that is pressed using the pygame module. The project sounds were recorded by Lawrence Perez using a Keychron K2 keyboard in 2019 with a Fifine condencer microphone, so the sounds are very high quality!

## How to use

Install Python and pygame onto your system. Note that both Python and pygame are required. In on Linux, Python should be installed. Install pygame by typing pip install pygame.

run python typing.py at the command prompt, and then type anything. You should hear keyboard typing sounds from your computer as you type.

Random sounds will play with each key you press, with a few exceptions. The space bar has it's own unique sound. Pressing CTRL+S will stop all sounds from playing. Pressing the escape key will exit the program.

Because I asked an AI called ChatGPT to help me make this file, I am keeping the original code so that developers can compair the two files. The version that ChatGPT generated can be found at typing_ChatGPT.py.
